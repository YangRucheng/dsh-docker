# Chinese support: a UTF-8 locale plus CJK fonts. Both are missing from the
# `node:*-slim` base, and each breaks Chinese in its own way:
#   * Without a UTF-8 locale (base image leaves LANG unset and LC_CTYPE=POSIX)
#     every POSIX tool treats bytes as characters: `ps` prints `????`, `wc -m`
#     and `awk length` count bytes (中文 = 6, not 2), `cut -c`/`fold -w` split a
#     character in half, and bash's `${#var}` plus arrow-key line editing
#     mis-measure CJK, so editing Chinese on the shell's command line breaks.
#     LANG is inherited by the `dsh web` process and survives the harness's
#     subprocess env scrub (`scrubbedParentEnv` deliberately keeps locale
#     variables), so it reaches both the agent shell (terminal-bash) and the GUI
#     terminal (terminal-controller) without touching upstream code.
#   * Without CJK fonts, fontconfig answers `:lang=zh` with DejaVu, which has no
#     CJK glyphs, so anything the container renders itself (headless Chromium /
#     browser-use screenshots, document previews) comes out as tofu boxes.
#     `fonts-noto-cjk` also ships *Noto Sans Mono CJK SC*, the only family whose
#     Latin advance is exactly half its CJK advance -- that 1:2 ratio is what the
#     GUI terminal needs to draw a double-width character inside exactly the two
#     cells xterm allocates for it (see scripts/terminal-font).
# Every claim above is asserted below, so an upstream base-image or font-package
# change fails the build loudly instead of silently shipping a Chinese-broken
# image. The 中文 probe is written as octal UTF-8 escapes to keep the assertion
# independent of this file's own encoding.
